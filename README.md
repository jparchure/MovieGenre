Movie Genre Viewing Preferences
==========

Creates a D3 Visualization of the Movie Genre Preferences accross continents data
This was developed as a part of my Human Computer Interactions class and makes use of the d3.js library (https://github.com/mbostock/d3)
to come up with a visual representation of the Movie genre dataset.

For more details on the infoviz and the interactions- check this page (http://jparchure.github.io/MovieGenre/)
